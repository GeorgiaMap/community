Throughout my career, I've always been driven to work for organizations where I can make a tangible impact. My most recent role as an Associate Software Engineer at Dure Technologies is a great example of this. There, I had the opportunity to build software that supported global health programs in over 35 countries , directly aiding UN agencies and tens of thousands of health workers. Seeing my technical skills in Java, Python and system design translate into real-world positive outcomes was incredibly fulfilling.

When I saw the volunteer opening at Model Earth, I was immediately drawn to your mission.

Technically, I bring deep experience in:
•	ML/DL frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
•	NLP and GenAI systems using transformers and embeddings
•	MLOps tools like Airflow, MLflow, Docker, and GitHub Actions
•	Distributed computing with Spark and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP)

Across roles, I’ve focused on building real-world ML systems that are:
•	Robust: containerized with Docker/Kubernetes, deployed via CI/CD pipelines
•	Scalable: using distributed compute with Spark, Airflow, and GPU-based training
•	Traceable: with experiment tracking, version control (MLflow, DVC), and reproducible builds
•	Explainable: using SHAP, LIME, and interpretable modeling for business-facing features

In addition to strong foundations in ML and deep learning (CNNs, transformers, XGBoost, PyTorch), I bring experience with cloud platforms (GCP, AWS), NLP pipelines, recommender systems, and vector-based search using tools like FAISS and Sentence Transformers. I’ve also collaborated in Agile environments with data scientists, software engineers, and product teams to iterate quickly and deploy reliably.

1. On RealityStream, I can productionize the current notebooks (LogReg/SVM/XGBoost/RF) with a clean CLI + tests, add Google Data Commons feature/target pulls, and standardize SHAP explainability reports—leveraging my Python + ML ops background and GPU acceleration experience. 

 2. On Planet, I can extend the LangChain JS ‘Active Reader’ flow into a robust RAG/agent pipeline (vector store, re-ranking, eval harness), and add governance basics (PII redaction, prompt-injection defenses) drawn from my prior multi-tool agent work. I’m comfortable bridging Python ↔ JS, so I can ship end-to-end data+LLM features across both repos.","Great Jobs, Energy, Vibrant Economies, Local Innovation, Fast Reliable Transit, High Speed Internet","University of Maryland, College Park — M.S. in Information Systems (Robert H.
