# Welcome!

Thanks for your interest in joining DreamStudio's Model.earth data science team!  

We are an all volunteer, for-profit organization.

Here's our [Member List](../) and [New Member Signup](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXSX0_myDcB4_Z32hpGC71PXVsMmgy_dyZPY0aPEWamyzV-w/viewform) link.

Our weekly Google Meet link is always the same: [model.earth/io/coders](https://model.earth/io/coders)

We ask that participants not list us on their resume or LinkedIn until they've been actively contributing updates for a few weeks. Your contributions to our team projects provide a basis for assessment if job interviewers contact us to confirm ongoing participation.

**IMPORTANT:** We don't provide letters of experience or closure unless there are specific contributions made using Github Pull Requests. Email is the main way we plan and track progress.

Find projects that fit your goals within our [Project Hub](https://github.com/modelearth/projects/issues) and [Active Projects page](../../../projects). Associate your GitHub account to the issue(s) you're contributing to and send Loren an email with a link to the issue. Loren will update the issue's intro with your focus and progress. Add notes for others in our README files as you contribute code.
